# 🍷cocktail-randomizer🍸
 
 
A group effort to make an app that randomizes the drink type of your choice.
When you first load the page you will hit the dropdown menu and that will allow you to select 4 alcohol types.
 
From there it will give you a random drink (from the alcohol type you selected) and you will be presented with the name of the drink as well as a picture, ingredients and instructions on how to make it.
 
If you want a new drink you can hit the button on the bottom to give you a new drink.
